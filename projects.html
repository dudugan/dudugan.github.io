                I've composed music for two video games (one above and the other below),
                and am currently working on a character suite
                for Fonda Lee's <i>Green Bone Saga</i>, as well as
                the score of a short sci-fi/western animated film.
                Using the Tone.js library, I've
                composed and coded <a class="fakelink"

                I play bass in a band at Yale,
