            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            
            <p>
                I'm 
                interested in animals (including humans),
                aliens, artificial intelligence, 
                and ancient people. More specifically,
                I'm interested in developing accurate 
                formalisms for how these groups might communicate,
                and aligning them with realistic hypotheses
                about evolution and emergence. 
                <br><br>

                I want to understand why human language is special - what we have that
                other species don't - and how we can represent these things formally,
                how they might have
                evolved, and how they give rise to cross-linguistic variation. 
                <br><br>
                
                I also want to understand what our brains can access at each stage
                of producing and comprehending a phrase, and what the link is between
                a grammar of competence and these on-line tasks.
                <br><br>

                Here are some projects I've been working on:
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                
                And here are some specific
                questions I've been thinking about lately:
            </p>
            

            <ul>
                
                <li class="button1">How can we align hypotheses about locality conditions on long-distance
                    phenomena (movement, agreement, case, binding, chains) with what we know 
                    about real-time production and comprehension
                </li>
                <li class="button2">How are clauses smaller than CPs embedded, and how are they interpreted
                    without CP or NP shells? How do nonfactive verbs select for them?
                </li>
                <li class="button3">Could semantic/logical equivalence explain
                    syntactic variation in the representation of non-referential
                    nominal predicates?
                </li>
                <li class="button4">Does birdsong, whalesong, or any other form of non-human learned
                    communication contain long-distance dependencies?
                </li>
                <!-- <li class="button4">How did dolphins evolve learned communication, given
                    their current lack of strong mate choice?
                </li> -->
                <li class="button5">How do we reconcile allosemy with the selectional restrictions of light verbs?</li>
                <li class="button6">How are head-finality and the pronunciation site of head movement
                    represented as parameters in the brain?
                </li>

                <!-- <li class= "button7">Was the evolution of learned communication in humans
                    related to the evolution of pair-bonding?
                </li> -->
                <!-- <li class="button8">Is it possible to reconcile dependent case theory with
                    phase theory in a way that provides explanatory and not just descriptive adequacy for
                    case patterns?
                </li> -->
                
                <!-- <li class="button2">How can long-distance dependencies be represented as local feature
                    spreading without overgeneration and rampant invisibility?
                </li> -->
                <li class="button7">What do species with learned communication use it for besides
                attracting mates and defending territory, and how might these uses have evolved, culturally or genetically?</li>
            </ul>

              

            <!-- <p>Following is a non-exhaustive list of specific research topics prompted by the above
                questions, which I hope to explore in the future: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>How does a head-final language evolve into a head-initial one, and vice versa?
                    How can we represent parameters like head-finality formally in 
                    plausibly-evolved/acquired cognitive structures?
                </li>
                <li>If syntax is “just Merge,” how can we encode syntactic universals (e.g. phrase ordering, 
                    adjective ordering)
                    into a semantic formalism? How can we use syntactic and semantic universals 
                    and conceptual structure as learned from neuro/psych experiments as evidence
                    for a semantic formalism? -->
                <!-- <li class="button3">Is there strong phylogenetic signal between the evolution of learned communication in bird species
                    and the strength of sexual selection?
                </li> -->
                <!-- </li>
                <li>Does noun case come from externalization or from conceptual structure? How does it evolve between languages, and 
                    why does it exist at all?
                </li> -->
                <!-- <li>Do birds and whales remember songs in ‘chunks’?</li> -->
                <!-- <li>How can we formally represent the communication systems of eusocial insects?</li> -->
                <!-- <li>How can we formally represent the ‘neuralese’ of an LLM, and how might we predict
                    the structure of an LLM's ‘neuralese’ based on its training data and reinforcement
                    algorithms?

                        <li>What cognitive data structures must exist
                            to represent human language, and how

                            variation (phonological, morphosyntactic,
                            semantic, pragmatic)? What does this tell us
                            about how we represent language cognitively?

                        <li>
                            Which aspects of the human language faculty

                        <li>
                            Why and how did human language evolve? Why and how

                            how can we tell what aspects of language it does or doesn't
                            have?

                            Is the human language faculty ‘perfect’? Are there other
                            ways of communicating unbounded propositional information
                            that are more likely to have evolved in other scenarios?
